# 🎉 Google Calendar Integration - FIXED!

## ✅ The Problem Was Found!

Your terminal logs revealed the exact issue:

```
✅ Successfully received tokens from Google
❌ Failed to parse FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY
```

**The OAuth flow was working perfectly!** The problem was:
- ✅ Google accepted your credentials
- ✅ Authorization code was received
- ✅ Tokens were successfully exchanged
- ❌ **But then it failed to save the tokens to Firestore**

## 🐛 Root Cause

Your `.env` file had **duplicate/malformed JSON** in the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`:
- It had the JSON content wrapped in quotes and escaped
- THEN it had the same content again without quotes
- This caused: `SyntaxError: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 4`

## 🔧 What I Fixed

I cleaned up the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` in your `.env` file to be valid JSON on a single line (no escaped quotes, no duplication).

## 🚀 Test It Now!

**IMPORTANT: You MUST restart your dev server for the changes to take effect!**

1. **Stop the current server**:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where npm run dev is running
   ```

2. **Restart it**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the integration**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:9002/profile`
   - Click "Connect to Google Calendar"
   - Complete the OAuth flow
   - You should see "Google Calendar Connected" ✅

## 📊 Expected Terminal Output

After restarting and trying again, you should see:

```
🔵 OAuth callback route hit
📥 Callback parameters: { hasCode: true, hasState: true, error: null }
✅ Code and state present, attempting token exchange...
Attempting to exchange auth code for tokens...
Using redirect URI: http://localhost:9002/api/auth/callback/google
Client ID: 626373907683-dba13o7ria1fngkjec27ol33sdek26sn.apps.googleusercontent.com
User ID: [your-user-id]
Successfully received tokens from Google
Successfully stored Google Calendar tokens for user: [your-user-id]
📊 Token exchange result: { success: true }
✅ Success! Redirecting to profile...
```

## ✨ What Will Work Now

After fixing this, you'll be able to:
1. ✅ Connect to Google Calendar successfully
2. ✅ See "Google Calendar Connected" status on your profile
3. ✅ Add tasks to Google Calendar from your app
4. ✅ Tokens will be stored in Firestore for future use

## 🎯 Summary of All Fixes

Throughout this debugging session, I fixed:

1. **OAuth callback redirect logic** - Normalized 0.0.0.0 to localhost
2. **Firebase SDK mismatch** - Used proper Firebase Admin methods
3. **Enhanced error logging** - Added detailed logs throughout the flow
4. **Firebase service account key** - Fixed malformed JSON (THE KEY FIX!)

## 📚 Documentation Created

I've created several helpful guides:
- `OAUTH_REDIRECT_FIX.md` - OAuth redirect URI issues
- `TOKEN_EXCHANGE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Detailed troubleshooting
- `DEBUG_CALENDAR_INTEGRATION.md` - Comprehensive debugging guide
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` - Updated setup instructions

## 🎊 You're All Set!

Just **restart your dev server** and try connecting to Google Calendar again. It should work perfectly now! 🚀
