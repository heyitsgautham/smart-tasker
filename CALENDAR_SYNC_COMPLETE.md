# 🎉 Google Calendar Sync - Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your SmartTasker app now has **full Google Calendar integration**! Here's what you can do:

### 1. **Automatic Task Sync** 
When you create a new task with a due date, it's **automatically added to Google Calendar**.

### 2. **Bulk Sync Existing Tasks**
A new "Sync All Tasks to Calendar" button on your profile page allows you to sync all existing pending tasks with due dates to Google Calendar in one click.

## 🎯 How It Works

### For New Tasks
1. Create a task with a due date and time
2. The task is saved to Firestore
3. **Automatically** added to your Google Calendar in the background
4. If sync fails, it logs an error (doesn't block task creation)

### For Existing Tasks
1. Go to your profile page (`/profile`)
2. You'll see "✓ Google Calendar Connected"
3. Click **"Sync All Tasks to Calendar"** button
4. The app will:
   - Find all pending tasks with due dates
   - Add each to Google Calendar
   - Show you a summary: "Synced X task(s), skipped Y (no due date)"

## 📁 Files Modified

### 1. `/src/app/actions.ts`
**Added**: `syncAllTasksToCalendar()` function
- Fetches all pending tasks for a user
- Filters tasks with due dates
- Syncs each task to Google Calendar
- Returns detailed results (synced, skipped, failed counts)

### 2. `/src/app/profile/page.tsx`
**Added**:
- "Sync All Tasks to Calendar" button
- `handleSyncAllTasks()` function
- Loading states and progress feedback
- User-friendly success/error messages

### 3. `/src/ai/flows/add-google-calendar-event.ts`
**Fixed**:
- Removed client-side Firebase imports
- Now uses Firebase Admin SDK exclusively
- Properly handles token refresh
- More robust error handling

## 🚀 How to Use

### Initial Setup (Already Done!)
✅ Google Calendar OAuth configured  
✅ Calendar connection working  
✅ Tokens stored securely in Firestore

### Sync All Existing Tasks
1. Go to `http://localhost:9002/profile`
2. You'll see: "✓ Google Calendar Connected"
3. Click **"Sync All Tasks to Calendar"**
4. Wait for the sync to complete
5. You'll see a message like:
   ```
   Synced 5 task(s) to Google Calendar.
   2 task(s) skipped (no due date).
   ```

### Create New Tasks
1. Go to the dashboard
2. Click **"Add Task"**
3. Fill in details (title, description, **due date**)
4. Click "Add Task"
5. Task is automatically added to your calendar! 🎉

## 📊 Sync Results

The sync function provides detailed feedback:

```typescript
{
  success: true,
  synced: 5,        // Tasks successfully added to calendar
  skipped: 2,       // Tasks without due dates
  failed: 0,        // Tasks that failed to sync
  message: "Synced 5 task(s) to Google Calendar. 2 task(s) skipped (no due date)."
}
```

## 🔍 What Gets Synced

**Included**:
- ✅ Task title (as event summary)
- ✅ Task description (as event description)
- ✅ Due date and time (as event start/end)
- ✅ Your local timezone

**Not Included**:
- ❌ Tasks without due dates (automatically skipped)
- ❌ Completed tasks (only pending tasks are synced)
- ❌ Task priority (not a Google Calendar field)

## 🎨 UI Features

### Profile Page
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ✓ Google Calendar Connected         │

│ [🔄 Sync All Tasks to Calendar]    │
│                                     │
│ This will add all your pending      │
│ tasks with due dates to Google      │
│ Calendar.                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### During Sync
- Button shows: "⏳ Syncing Tasks..."
- Button is disabled to prevent double-clicks
- Loading spinner appears

### After Sync
- Success toast: "Sync Complete - Synced X task(s)..."
- Or error toast with details if something goes wrong

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Token Management
- Access tokens are stored in Firestore (`googleCalendarTokens` collection)
- Tokens are automatically refreshed when expired
- If refresh fails, user is prompted to reconnect

### Error Handling
- Individual task sync failures don't stop the entire process
- Detailed error messages for each failed task
- Graceful fallback for missing calendar connection

### Performance
- Sync runs in the background for new tasks
- Bulk sync processes tasks sequentially (prevents API rate limits)
- No blocking of UI during sync operations

## 🧪 Test It!

### Test Scenario 1: Sync Existing Tasks
1. Make sure you have some tasks with due dates
2. Go to profile page
3. Click "Sync All Tasks to Calendar"
4. Check your Google Calendar - they should appear!

### Test Scenario 2: Create New Task
1. Create a new task with:
   - Title: "Test Google Calendar Sync"
   - Due Date: Tomorrow at 2:00 PM
2. Save the task
3. Check your Google Calendar - it should appear immediately!

### Test Scenario 3: Task Without Due Date
1. Create a task without a due date
2. It will be saved but NOT added to calendar
3. Sync button will skip it (by design)

- ✅ Automatic sync for new tasks
