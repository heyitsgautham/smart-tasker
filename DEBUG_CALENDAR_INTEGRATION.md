# üîß Google Calendar Integration - Critical Fix Needed

## üéØ Key Discovery

After analyzing the Google Calendar API documentation you provided, I've identified that your OAuth configuration is **correct**, but we need to understand why the token exchange is failing.

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. ‚úÖ Environment variables are properly set
2. ‚úÖ OAuth2 client is created successfully  
3. ‚úÖ Auth URL is generated correctly
4. ‚úÖ Client ID format is valid
5. ‚úÖ Redirect URI is correctly formatted

## üîç What We Need to Check

### Critical Question: Can you share the exact error from the server terminal?

After you click "Connect to Google Calendar" and complete the OAuth flow, check your terminal where `npm run dev` is running. You should see log output like:

```
Attempting to exchange auth code for tokens...
Using redirect URI: http://localhost:9002/api/auth/callback/google
Client ID: 626373907683-dba13o7ria1fngkjec27ol33sdek26sn.apps.googleusercontent.com
User ID: [your-user-id]
```

**Then you should see either:**
- `Successfully received tokens from Google` ‚úÖ
- OR an error message with details ‚ùå

## üéØ Most Likely Issues

### Issue 1: Google Cloud Console Redirect URI Mismatch

**Check this in Google Cloud Console:**
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Under "Authorized redirect URIs", you MUST have EXACTLY:
   ```
   http://localhost:9002/api/auth/callback/google
   ```

**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå `http://localhost:9002/api/oauth/google/callback` (wrong path)
- ‚ùå `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` (wrong port)
- ‚ùå `https://localhost:9002/api/auth/callback/google` (should be http, not https)
- ‚ùå Extra trailing slash

### Issue 2: Google Calendar API Not Enabled

**Check in Google Cloud Console:**
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library
2. Search for "Google Calendar API"
3. It should say "API enabled" with a green checkmark
4. If it says "Enable", click it

### Issue 3: OAuth Consent Screen Not Configured

**Check in Google Cloud Console:**
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
2. Make sure:
   - App name is set
   - User support email is set
   - Your email is added as a test user (if publishing status is "Testing")

### Issue 4: Wrong Project in Google Cloud Console

**Verify:**
- The OAuth credentials you created are in the same Google Cloud project
- The project ID matches your Firebase project: `smarttasker-gk`

## üìã Step-by-Step Verification

### Step 1: Verify Google Cloud Console Setup

Run through this checklist:

```
‚ñ° Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
‚ñ° Select project: smarttasker-gk (or your project)
‚ñ° Find OAuth 2.0 Client ID: 626373907683-dba13o7ria1fngkjec27ol33sdek26sn
‚ñ° Click on it to edit
‚ñ° Under "Authorized redirect URIs", verify EXACT match:
  http://localhost:9002/api/auth/callback/google
‚ñ° Click Save if you made any changes
‚ñ° Wait 5 minutes for changes to propagate
```

### Step 2: Enable Calendar API

```
‚ñ° Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com
‚ñ° Click "Enable" if not already enabled
‚ñ° Wait 1-2 minutes
```

### Step 3: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

```
‚ñ° Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
‚ñ° If "Publishing status" is "Testing":
  ‚ñ° Click "Test users" ‚Üí "Add users"
  ‚ñ° Add your Gmail address: heyitsgautham@gmail.com
  ‚ñ° Click "Save"
```

### Step 4: Test Again

1. **Clear your browser cookies** for localhost:9002
2. Go to: `http://localhost:9002/profile` (use localhost, NOT 0.0.0.0)
3. Click "Connect to Google Calendar"
4. **Watch the terminal** where `npm run dev` is running
5. Complete the OAuth flow in your browser
6. **Copy the error logs** from the terminal and share them

## üîç Debug Command

Run this command and share the output:

```bash
cd /Users/gauthamkrishna/Projects/smart-tasker
node scripts/test-google-oauth.js
```

This will verify your OAuth configuration is correct.

## üì∏ What to Check in Browser Network Tab

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Try connecting to Google Calendar
4. Look for the request to `/api/auth/callback/google`
5. Check:
   - Does it have a `code` parameter?
   - Does it have a `state` parameter?
   - Are there any error parameters?

## üö® Common Error Messages Decoded

| Error in Terminal | Meaning | Solution |
|-------------------|---------|----------|
| `redirect_uri_mismatch` | Redirect URI doesn't match Google Console | Update Google Console to match exactly: `http://localhost:9002/api/auth/callback/google` |
| `invalid_grant` | Auth code expired or already used | Try the OAuth flow again from scratch |
| `invalid_client` | Client ID or Secret is wrong | Double-check credentials in `.env` file |
| `access_denied` | User denied permissions OR not a test user | Add your email as test user in OAuth consent screen |
| `unauthorized_client` | Calendar API not enabled | Enable Google Calendar API in Google Cloud Console |

## üéØ Action Items

1. **Verify redirect URI** in Google Cloud Console matches EXACTLY
2. **Enable Google Calendar API** if not already enabled
3. **Add your email as test user** if consent screen is in Testing mode
4. **Clear browser cookies** before testing again
5. **Use localhost** (not 0.0.0.0) when accessing the app
6. **Share the terminal error logs** so I can see the exact error from Google

## üí° Why the Documentation Uses a Different Approach

The HTML file you showed uses Google's **client-side** OAuth (implicit flow) which:
- Handles tokens directly in the browser
- Uses `google.accounts.oauth2.initTokenClient()`
- Requires an API key

Your Next.js app uses **server-side** OAuth (authorization code flow) which:
- Is more secure
- Tokens are handled on the server
- Doesn't need an API key for googleapis library
- Is the recommended approach for server-rendered apps

Both approaches are valid, but your current approach is better for a Next.js app with server actions! üéâ

**Next Step: Please share the terminal logs after trying to connect to Google Calendar!**
